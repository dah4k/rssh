1.0.0

Initial release version (non-beta)

1.0.1

Added support to configure to check for OpenSSH 3.5, and disables static
compilation if found

1.0.2

Automake support

1.0.3

Uh, I forgot to update this

1.0.4

minor bug fix

2.0.0

Some code clean-up, and added config file, with support for:

  - setting default umask
  - configuring whether scp and/or sftp are allowed
  - setting the syslog facility to which to log
  - support for chroot jails

...and there was much rejoicing.  All configuration options are currently
global.  In the next major release of rssh, they will be configurable on a
per-user basis (which will override global settings).

Added rssh_chroot_helper for (hopefully) implementing the chroot jail
securely.

2.0.1

 - fixed bug preventing scp from working
 - documentation update for using chroot jails
 - updated the INSTALL file with hints for Solaris 

2.0.2

 - removed references to scpsh and sftpsh from README
 - changed strcmp in main.c to use PATH_SCP rather than scp
 - made rssh_chroot_helper check # of args, plus minor log mods to support
 - minor fixes in CHROOT hints file
 - actually called umask() to set the umask...
 - added patches to configure.ac for compiling on non-GNU platforms

2.0.4

 - fixed quote processing in config file parser
 - fixed command line argvec building for args with spaces
 - cleaned up a number of other little verbiage things, etc.
 - changed default shell opts to allow only scp if config file doesn't exist

2.1.0

 - added per-user configuration
 - fixed a number of heretofore unnoticed bugs in the parser and elsewhere
 - added examples to the config file
