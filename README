rssh readme
-----------

The purpose of rssh is to allow system administrators to restrict ssh access
to a particular host.  It can be used to provide scp access, sftp access, or
both.  Formerly, this was done based on the name of the shell binary (or
symlink to it), but is now done via config file.

IMPORTANT: If you do not want your users to be able to circumvent rssh, read the
security notes in the file SECURITY, and note the section about linking in the
file INSTALL.

For instructions on how to install rssh, see the file INSTALL.  For more
information about using chroot jails with rssh, see the file CHROOT.
